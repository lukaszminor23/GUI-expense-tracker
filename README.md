# Expense Tracker

This is a rebuild of the first python project that I ever wrote. The last project on an online bootcamp that I did, was a home budget/expense tracker app using a command line interface, so I decided to make one with graphical interface instead so it would be easier to use by my wife.

## Description

Expense Tracker is a Python application that helps users keep track of their daily expenses. It provides a graphical user interface built with Tkinter and stores data in an SQLite database. Users can add, delete, display expenses, and a chart can be generated to visualize the data.

## Features

- Add expenses with category, amount, and date.
- Delete expenses.
- Display a chart to visualize expense data.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/lukaszminor23/expense-tracker.git
Install matplotlib library:

    pip install matplotlib
Run the app:

    python main.py

## Usage
- Launch the application.
- Enter the category, amount, and date for the expense.
- Click the "Add item" button to add the expense.
- Click the "Delete item" button to remove the highlighted expense.
- Click the "Display chart" button to visualize expense data.
